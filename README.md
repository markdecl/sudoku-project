# sudoku-project

I was keen to practise my skills in HTML, CSS, and JS through completing an independent project. So I built a Sudoku game that runs in-browser, complete with basic gameplay, a new game generator, and 'Hint' and 'AutoSolve' features powered by a backtracking algorithm.

## Demo:

### Basic gameplay on the interface

### New game generator

### _Hint_ and _AutoSolve_ features

## Tools and technologies used:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* ES6

## Challenges:


## Credits:

## TODO:
* Stop buttons from moving when one is hovered over
* Increase buttons' size and buttons' font size
* Move input box text content to grid cell text content when the grid cell is deselected
* Deselect cell when there's a click event outside the grid
  * Add an event listener to body and link to function that deselects all grid cells
* Implement auto-solver and auto-generator features
